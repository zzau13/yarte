# Yarte [![Latest version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/yarte.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/yarte) [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1ccce8b0-cb08-41b1-a781-f883a6cc7767/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/yarte/deploys)
Yarte stands for **Y**et **A**nother **R**usty **T**emplate **E**ngine. Uses a Handlebars-like syntax, 
well-known and intuitive for most developers. Yarte is an optimized, and easy-to-use 
rust crate, with which developers can create logic around their 
HTML templates using conditionals, loops, rust code and template composition.

## Documentation
In order to  fully understand Yarte's capabilities take a look at the following documentation:
- [Tests](./yarte/tests)
- [Our book](https://yarte.netlify.com/)
- [Crate documentation](https://docs.rs/yarte/)

Or, in nightly, just:
```rust
#[yarte] "{{> my_template }}"
```
`bytes-buf` feature can produce **SIGILL**.
More details in https://github.com/botika/v_escape/issues/54.

Yarte is under development.

### Is it really fast?
Run `cargo bench` with rust nightly.

Results in my `AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX`

See it for yourself in the [TechEmpower benchmarks][bench] with [`actix`][actix] and [`ntex`][ntex]

## Acknowledgment
Yarte is based on all previous templates engines, syntax as well as its documentation 
is highly influenced by [Handlebars][handlebars].
